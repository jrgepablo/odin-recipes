    <p>"Ceviche is the national dish of Peru consisting of slices of raw fish or shellfish that is spiced with salt, onions, and chili peppers, then marinated in lime juice," reads the dish description. "Due to the acidity of lime juice, the texture of the fish changes, as does its color â€“ from pink to white.</p>
